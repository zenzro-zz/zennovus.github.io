				Smart Devices Information Leak

				Smart Devices Information Leak:
				This is information produced by an article with the NBC News. Smart home devices have become common technology within many homes today. These devices range from Televisions, Streaming boxes, and Personal Digital Assistants. With new innovations in technology comes the chance for personal data to be carelessly misused. 
				The article [https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/smart-tvs-smart-home-devices-found-be-leaking-sensitive-user-n1055796] describes how these devices have been found to leak sensitive data despite particular services being started or setup. A team of researchers from Northeastern University & the Imperial College of London have found that a variety of devices have collected and distributed customer data even if a consumer didn't interact with the companies. Practically all smart tv devices tested were found to contact apps such as Netflix despite accounts never being setup. Other apps were found to do the same things and when traced the data was found to be sent to known companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon as well as third party companies like Mixpanel.com that helps other companies improve products through data gained for customer research. It was noted that is data being sent without permission was indeed encrypted making it somewhat safe but at the same time this prevented the researchers from understanding what and how much user data was being sent. At this time since there is no way to fully configure your smart home devices to do things such as block network traffic it leaves only one solution to combat this ever growing problem, and that is to delete the applications not in use entirely. Issues like this have to gain focus in our fast developing technological world. Once we lose control of our confidential liberties we begin to become controlled by devices and institutions that we once had control over.
