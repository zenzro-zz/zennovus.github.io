				Smart Devices Information Leak

					Smart Devices Information Leak:
					<br>
					This is information produced by an article with the NBC News. Smart home devices have become common technology within many homes today. These devices range from Televisions, Streaming boxes, and Personal Digital Assistants. With new innovations in technology comes the chance for personal data to be carelessly misused.
					<br>	
					The article [https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/smart-tvs-smart-home-devices-found-be-leaking-sensitive-user-n1055796] describes how these devices have been found to leak sensitive data despite particular services being started or setup. A team of researchers from Northeastern University & the Imperial College of London have found that a variety of devices have collected and distributed customer data even if a consumer didn't interact with the companies. Practically all smart tv devices tested were found to contact apps such as Netflix despite accounts never being setup. Other apps were found to do the same things and when traced the data was found to be sent to known companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon as well as third party companies like Mixpanel.com that helps other companies improve products through data gained for customer research. It was noted that is data being sent without permission was indeed encrypted making it somewhat safe but at the same time this prevented the researchers from understanding what and how much user data was being sent. At this time since there is no way to fully configure your smart home devices to do things such as block network traffic it leaves only one solution to combat this ever growing problem, and that is to delete the applications not in use entirely. Issues like this have to gain focus in our fast developing technological world. Once we lose control of our confidential liberties we begin to become controlled by devices and institutions that we once had control over.

				Nimbda Virus

				<p>
				Nimbda Virus:
				<br>
				Deployed in 2001 and detected in September of that year the Nimda virus is a malicious worm. It was a malicious file infecting computer worm that quickly spread surpassing the economic damage caused by previous outbreaks such as Code Red.It probes each IP address within a randomly-selected range of IP addresses, attempting to exploit weaknesses that, unless already patched, are known to exist in computers with Microsoft's Internet Information Server. A system with an exposed IIS Web server will read a Web page containing an embedded JavaScript that automatically executes, causing the same JavaScript code to propagate to all Web pages on that server.Nimda also can infect users within the Web server's own internal network that have been given a network share (a portion of file space).One of the things that Nimda has an infected system do is to send an e-mail with a "readme.exe" attachment to the addresses in the local Windows address book. A user who opens or previews this attachment (which is a Web page with the JavaScript) propagates the virus further. Nimda appears to be the most troublesome virus of its type that has yet appeared. Its name (backwards for "admin") apparently refers to an "admin.dll" file that, when run, continues to propagate the virus.
